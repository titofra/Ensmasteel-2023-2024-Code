> [!CAUTION]
> This code depends on class created for Teensy's board. However, they depend on uncompatible code with a local compilation (e.g. <Arduino.h>, <Stream.h> ...). This is why necessary code is copied and edited under include/ and src/: **they must be updated** to match with the actual files at Teensy/include/ and Teensy/src/!

## Dependencies
